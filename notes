core java:
``````````
what is java?

  java is object oriented programming language.
  
 why we need to learn this pl?
  python
  java
  .net
  c,cpp... 
   to develop the software application 
   
 java:
 
   1995 
   28 years ago
   james gosling -author 
   sunmicrosystem 
   
   popularity -> java has unique principles.
   
   
  oopl 

  using java, what kind of applications we can develop?

  
   ->desktop applications & webbased applications
   
   
   core java -> jse(java standard edition)
    -desktop applications.
	
	adv java ->jee(java enterprise edition)
	 -webbased applications.
	 
   1995 
   
    jamesgosling 
	
	 into three editions
	 
	 1.jse (core java) 2.jee(advanced java)
	 
	 
	jse:

oops princples
control statements
instance vs static 
class vs object
string manipulation 
collection framework
files concept
multithreading intro
exception handling 
lambda expression and stream api 
etc.. 
	
		
		
	 
	 

java is oopl

 ->what is oopl?
 
  xyz  -> oopl 
  
  it has to follow some principles
   oops princples.
   
   we have 4 oops principles.
   
   1.inheritance
   2.encapsulation 
   3.polymorphism 
   4.abstraction 
   

as a programmer what is our role?
 
  to write the program
  
  
  we have to follow some rules.
  
  syntaxes-language vendors 
  in case of java-> sunmicrosystem
  
  oracle corporation 
  (www.oracle.com)
  
  
 scjp -> sun certfied java programmer
 ocjp -> oracle certfied java programmer

 
syntaxes we have on each and every concept 

  class <classname>
  {
  }
  
     <datatype> <varaiblename>;
	 
	 <returntype> <methodname>()
	 {
	 }
	 

basic structure of java program?

   every java program should statt with by defining the class 
   only.
   
   how can we define the class?
    
	  syntax:
	  
    class <classname>
	{
	}

ex:
  class Student{
  }
  

we need to save it.
<filename>.java

   
  compile the java program 
  execute the java program 

  we require java software
  
  c program -> turbo c cpp -> turbo cpp 
  java program -> java software -> jdk (java development kit)
  
  
  java is opensource.
  
  www.oracle.com
  
  
  
  https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk21-windows
  
  
  why should i compile the program ?
  
    java compiler is the predefined java program available in jdk. 
	
	 syntaxes are correct or not?
	 
	 
  if programmer is not following the syntaxes -> 
  compiler will give you errors.
  
  .java -> compiler -> generate -> .class file 
  
     java compiler will take .java file -> .class file 
	 jvm will take .class file -> machine level code 
	 
	 
  how can we compile the java program?
  
  open the command prompt.
  
    javac <filename>.java
	
how can i execute?

    java <classname>
	
	java Demo
	
  we have to define the main()
  because java program execution starts from main() method only.
  
  
  
  class Demo
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		//logic
		
		System.out.println("welcome to java sessions from techm");
    }
	
	
}
